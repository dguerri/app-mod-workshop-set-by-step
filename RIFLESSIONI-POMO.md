This is a public "post-mortem" to capture what worked and what didnt in 12oct24 @ Modena DevFest  `PHP Amarcord` very first workshop.

## Modena Workshop PostMortem

On Saturday 12 Oct 2024, Riccardo Carlesso drove a "PHP Amarcord" workshop in DevFest Modena, which seemed to be a success.

## Timeline

```bash
# All times are in CE(S)T üáÆüáπ. Date 2024-10-12
11:10 Started the workshop. Had around 10-15 people. Mirko Gilioli helped me run it. **BEGIN of workshop**
11:25 Finished presenting the slides - everyone had access
13:05 one student is able
13:10 Declared the end of the workshop. 90% of people got the app running locally or on Cloud Run. One person got CICD (Cloud Build) kind of working. Workshop ended with ~30 people more as people kept arriving at 11:40, 12:00, mnd so on. **END of workshop**
```

## About the workshoppers.

* People had a 50/50 of Windows setup (they were then suggested to go use Cloud Shell).

### Progress on workshop

* ~15 people were in the workshiop for 2h.
* Another 10-15 were in the workshop for 45-90min.

In that time,
* Everyone was able to set up Cloud SQL and connect to it.
* 15-20 people were able to dockerize it.
* 5-10 people were able to deploy to Cloud Run (some with correct MySQL connection)
* ?? people were able to set up Secret Manager
* 1 person was able to set up CI/CD on Cloud Build (broken)
* 2 people promised in blood they'd finish the workshop at home

### Dev issues / frictions

* [onramp] only 1 person had a problem with onramp, particularly to create a project after redemption (b/0002). After investigation, we realized they used a student email and not a gmail. It looks like - if you have an existing organization, it's impossible from UI to create a new project. It gives error as in "you need to choose unimo.it org". Not sure if this some sort of org policy applied to a certain domain emails or it is a UI bug.
* [github_fork] One person did their first fork ever, so we had to set up their SSH key. This was a bit lengthy -> good to add to prework.

## PoMo üçé 3 questions

### What worked

* onramp worked beautifully.
* After 15 slides, people were able to actually do the work. I said "do your stuff and call me when blocked" and people were rarely blocked. Two people were able to easily cover 20 people.
* People loved having a **Gemini API Key** to use outside the workshop. People were thrilled to be able to use it independently from this workshop in the next 3 months.
* Having a double setup documented (Cloud Shell vs power mode (`vscode`, download `gcloud`, `mysql`, `docker`, ..) worked well. People chose naturally the best for them. They oved cloud shell, but the UX was indeed clumsier to open/edit files.

### What didn't work

* A student used the `UniMo.it` account and could NOT reclaim BAID with that email. Luckily he could unblock by getting a second account on onramp with his gmail.
* People were confused on two repos - one with the PHP code, one with the `.env`. "Where is the .env?" came up 3 times. Make it clear, maybe add a slide.
* Very noisy room, I had to shout at people 5m from me and asked people 15m from me to come closer. This was a one-off issue (multi speaker space) - never happened before.

### Where we were lucky

* Few people were blocked at computer setup.
* Many power users. People contributed back (your Dockerfile supports PHP7.4 but you said 5.7? Let me build it for you and send you via email).

## Action items

* `b/0001` Verify if you can do something different than Cloud SQL. We calculate Cloud SQL will last ~24h.
     * Either teach them to configure Cloud Scheduler to turn off cloud sql `gcloud instances stop blah blah`
     * or use Firebase
     * or just tell them nicely (as I did) in some cleanup folder.
* `b/0002` [P1] Big error Unimo student coulod NOT create a project in no-org since they had one org (!! I swear I tried 5 times)
* `b/0003` [P3] Get feedback from Mirko and integrate here.
* `b/0004` [p2] Riccardo create a pre-work document to hand over to Gregorio to give to workshop participants, so they come with the repo already forked, and maybe onramp already created.
