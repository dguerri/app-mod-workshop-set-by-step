Ok, so you're done with the workshop and you want to go home?

**Before** yu go home, remember: if you got credits from a Googler/GDE, chances are that:

* if no cleanup is done, your Cloud SQL DB is going to eat up all your credit in ~24 hours.
* if you turn off the DB (`Cloud SQL` -> `<Your Instance>` -> `stop`), the rest of your installation should comfortably survive for the whole credit duration.

‚û°Ô∏è Hence..

## üßπ Cleanup

* **STOP the Cloud Instance**. TODO(ricc): add links and maybe a screenshot.
