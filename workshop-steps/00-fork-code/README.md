## [üöÑ speed] Note on git clone and ssh

If it's the first time you do the `git clone` with `ssh`, you might have to set up the SSH key both locally and on github side.

To optimize time üöÑ, you might want to just git clone with http, no password required. You won't be able to *push* to your repo but you can download the code, get started and edit locally.
