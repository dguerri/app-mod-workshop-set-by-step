You've completed EVERYTHING, what's missing?

Some food for thought:

## Uploads to GCS

This is a complex migration: you want

* Use PHP to send uploads to a GCS bucket.
* set up a secure Service Account that does that.
* enabled public bucket (for simplicity, or you can set up a more complex signed URL).
* pull/visualize images from the bucket.

To achieve this, you need to install PHP GCP libraries to access GCS.

## UI Lifting

I'm no good at UIs. But Gemini is! You can just take a single PHP page, and say something like this:

```
I have  VERY old PHP application. I want to touch it as little as possible. Can you help me:

1. add some nice CSS to it, a single static include for tailwind or similar, whatever you prefer
2. Transform the image print with description into cards, which fit 4 per line in the canvas?

Here's the code:

-----------------------------------
[Paste your PHP page, for instance index.php - mind the token limit!]
```

You can easily get this in less than 5 minutes, one Cloud Build away! :)
