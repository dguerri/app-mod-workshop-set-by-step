# How to use this

The workshop "PHP Amarcord" is done this way:

* navigate every folder in alpha order (starting with 00..)
* Scroll and execute each README.
* If you get stuck, ask for help. If you can't find help, check the resources in the folder. There might be solutions already prepared for you.


If you're completely stuck, get inspiration by this fully-functional app: https://github.com/Friends-of-Ricc/app-mod-workshop

This can be used as a self-paced workshop, or as a real-time classroom workshop. In this case, the instructors will give
you some time for each step and when the time is out, they'll provide solutions to quickly move to the next one.
