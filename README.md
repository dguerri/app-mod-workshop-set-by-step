This contains solutions (spoiler alert!) for the AppMod workshop invented by Riccardo and inspired by a failed
talk on AppMod: "scrap your old app to the Cloud" (*rottama la tua vecchia app verso il Cloud*).

## folder

* `app/` Contains a `curated` copy of the app (since i have no control of the original code).
    * Current commit: `35e71a981a53299319da1ff209be2b4e7b3e20c6` from Tue Oct 1 2024



## License

MIT just like original app.

## thanks

* Maurizio Ipsaleand Mirko Gilioli for having my workshop in GDG Modena.
